# Onboarding Flow

Defined in `lib/onboarding-flow.ts`. Linear sequence: referral -> name -> pronouns -> gender -> sexuality -> location -> birthday -> age-range -> height -> relationship-goals -> relationship-type -> kids -> wants-kids -> ethnicity -> hometown -> religion -> politics -> pets -> drinking -> smoking -> marijuana -> drugs -> photos.

## Shared Components

- **`OnboardingScreen`** (`components/OnboardingScreen.tsx`): Wrapper for all question pages. Handles fade animation, layout (scrollable or fixed), question heading, and footer with Next button. Accepts optional `onBack` prop to show a Back + Next button row (used in editing mode).
- **`OptionButton`** (`components/OptionButton.tsx`): Selectable option with `shadows.sm`, no border. Variants: `default` (full-width), `compact` (2-col grid), `pill` (rounded inline), `row` (equal-width side-by-side).
- **`ImportanceSlider`** (`components/ImportanceSlider.tsx`): "How important is it that your partner aligns with you here?" subquestion + 1-10 slider. Used by religion and politics pages.

## Editing Mode

When entering onboarding from the Questions tab ("The Basics" card), pages receive `editing=true` param. In editing mode:
- Layout shows X button (closes to Questions tab) instead of back arrow; progress bar still visible
- When all basics are complete, tapping "The Basics" card navigates to `basics-summary.tsx` (summary/edit page)
- Footer shows Back + Next buttons (like voice questions)
- `setOnboardingStep` is skipped (doesn't reset onboarding progress)
- `goToNextStep(router, step, isEditing)` carries the `editing` param forward
- The Basics card navigates to the first unanswered step (computed in `questions.tsx`)

## Basics Screens (one question per page)
1. **Name** (`name.tsx`): Text input
2. **Gender** (`gender.tsx`): "Woman", "Man", "Non-binary"
3. **Sexuality** (`sexuality.tsx`): "Men", "Women", "Everyone"
4. **Location** (`location.tsx`): `expo-location` auto-detect city/state
5. **Birthday** (`birthday.tsx`): `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`, 18+ required
6. **Age Range** (`age-range.tsx`): Dual-handle `MultiSlider` (18-99) + dealbreaker toggle. Defaults to own age +/-5. Stored as `ageRangeMin`, `ageRangeMax`, `ageRangeDealbreaker` on `users` table. When dealbreaker, matches outside range are hard-filtered from the matches page.
7. **Height** (`height.tsx`): Scrollable list of height options

## Structured Questions (stored in `users` table)
8. **Relationship Goals** (`relationship-goals.tsx`): Marriage, Long-term partner, etc.
9. **Kids** (`kids.tsx`): "Do you have children?" Yes/No (row layout)
10. **Wants Kids** (`wants-kids.tsx`): Yes, No, Open to it, Not sure
11. **Religion** (`religion.tsx`): 2-column grid + ImportanceSlider
12. **Politics** (`politics.tsx`): Column options + ImportanceSlider
13. **Substances**: Drinking/Smoking/Marijuana/Drugs screens with visibility toggles
14. **Photos** (`photos.tsx`): 6-slot grid, first 4 required. Last step -- the last item in `ONBOARDING_FLOW` auto-triggers `completeCategory("the_basics")`.

## Voice Questions Screen (`voice-questions.tsx`)
- Full-screen recording interface for 10 open-ended questions
- States: idle -> recording (waveform) -> preview
- Haptic feedback on start/stop/save/delete
- Auto-saves recordings to Convex storage
- All 10 complete -> auto-triggers `parseVoiceProfile` action
- Re-recording any question re-triggers full parsing
